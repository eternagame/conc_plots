# NUPACK-based Concentration Plots

You can make a set of plots for a single sequence by running

```python plot_conc_space.py [SEQUENCE] R105_states.txt -o output.png -t [TITLE]```

The `R105_states.txt` specifies the input and reporter sequences as well as which complexes to include in the calculation.
